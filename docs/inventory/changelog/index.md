## Version 1.7.0

### Features

* "How much would you like to drop/buy/sell/take/store?" modal dialog that opens, allowing gamepads and mouse/keyboard better control over how much of an item they want to drop
* On Gamepad, you'll now be able to scroll through an items description using the right thumbstick. This is useful for items with longer descriptions where the entire description doesn't fit inside the item inspector.
