# Quest Dialogue

As of Narrative [Tales 3.7.0](../changelog/index.md#version-370), Quest dialogue has been added to make it easier to track the main dialogue asset file that belongs to a quest.

Most quests will have some sort of dialogue associated with them. This link lets you join them to quickly jump / start them in the world.

You can set a quest's dialogue in the default settings.

This will give you access to a button in the toolbar to jump to the dialogue.

Or you can access it directly from the quest's properties.

## Dialogue

From the dialogue asset, you can access the quest from the toolbar.
