# Installation

To get started, we will be using the Narrative Tutorial Template project and Unreal Engine version 5.3. This template is a duplication of the Third Person template and contains a bunch of pre-setup features such as Metahumans to make this tutorial easier.

You can get the Narrative Tutorial Template here:

Alternatively, you can download the finished project here:

Extract the project then download Narrative from the Epic Marketplace and you can install it to the engine (default) or move it into your project's Plugins folder (you may have to create this folder).

Make sure to enable Narrative 3 and Narrative Common UI by going to edit -> Plugins, and checking the box next to Narrative 3 and Narrative Common UI. (you may have to restart Unreal)

We are now ready to configure Narrative.
