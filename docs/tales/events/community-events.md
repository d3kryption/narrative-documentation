# Community Events

Narrative features a bunch of generic events that can be used by the vast majority of users. However, at some point you will need to create your own events.

It's really easy to do but here are some events created by the community that will be useful from time to time.

## Destroy Actors

In games its very common to want to destroy an actor. Maybe a wall, a door or a character. This event lets you add a tag then remove all actors with the same tag. Great for clearing up entire quests.

### Properties

| Name | Type   | Description                                     |

| Tag  | string | The actor tag of the actors you want to delete. |
