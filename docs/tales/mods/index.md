# Mods

Narrative Tales was built to support the vast majority of requirements for game dialogue and quests.

However, sometimes minor modifications need to be made to make it suit your ideal purpose.

Suggestions that can be used by the vast majority of people can be added directly to the plugin, however, bespoke / unique changes are not added to prevent the plugin from becoming bloated for everyone.

Below is a list of common mods people add in for their games.

| [Show UI](./show-ui.md) | Adds a tick box that allows you to hide the quest from all UI. Useful for hidden quests such as achievements/trophies or sub-quests. |
