# Narrative Component

:::note

It is a common misconception that you need a Narrative component PER [dialogue](../dialogue) or per [quest](../quests).

This is not true. You need 1 Narrative component per group of players.

1 for Single player.

1 for Multi-player if coop or multiple if Mass-Multiplayer games.
