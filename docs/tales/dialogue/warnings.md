# Dialogue Warnings

By-default Narrative will give you warnings when [Dialogue Nodes](./index.md) have not been assigned audio cues.

This is a safety measure for games that want to use dialogue audio. 

You can disable these warnings by going to **Edit** -> **Project Settings** -> **Narrative Dialogue (Editor)**

Now you can untick `bWarnMissingSoundCues` to stop the warnings.
