# Default Interactables

Interaction contains a bunch of existing interactables for you to use to create your game. 

These interactables are commonly used interactions in most games and integrations with other plugins.

## Inventory

### Item Pickup

This will most likely be one of your most used interactions. It is used for picking up an item to add to the inventory. This takes care of all the properties, destruction's and adding to the inventory.

### Loot

This intractable component, not to be confused with the Loot Lockable allows you to initiate the looting from Narrative Inventory to start taking items from an actor such as a chest.

### Loot Lockable

This intractable component is for looting a lockable actor. If the actor is locked if you don’t have the correct key or requirements, you can use this to check that.

## Quests & Dialogue

### Begin Dialogue

This interactable component starts dialogue when interacted with. It comes with options to set the dialogue and its properties.

### Quest button

This intractable component, not to be confused with the BeginQuest interactable, completes a quest task. For example, you might have a task to press a button or interact with an actor. This quest button will complete that interaction.

### Begin Quest button

This intractable component begins a quest when interacted with. It comes with all the options you need to start the quest at the correct stage.
