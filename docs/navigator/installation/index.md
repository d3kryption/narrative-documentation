# Installation

To get started, we will be using the Third Person template.

Alternatively, you can get the download for the finished project here:

[Project download link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fJ-1kkUH81dfXBVt78z3ZcNBHUEKAt-9/view)

Set up the template project then download **Narrative Navigator** and **Narrative Common UI** from the Epic Marketplace and you can install it to the engine (default) or move it into your project's Plugins folder (you may have to create this folder).

Make sure to enable **Narrative Navigator** and **Narrative Common UI** by going to edit -> Plugins, and checking the box next to **Narrative Navigator** and **Narrative Common UI**. (you may have to restart Unreal)

We are now ready to configure Narrative Navigator.
