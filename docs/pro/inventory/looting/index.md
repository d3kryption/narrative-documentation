# Looting

Inventory contains a fully functional looting system to be able to take or transfer items from other inventories.

To add looting to a blueprint you need to do two things.

Add the [Inventory component](../inventory-component) to your blueprint, for example a **Chest**.

Now, depending on how you want to handle the start of the looting, you can either set up an interaction system such as [Narrative Interaction](../../interaction) or an overlap trigger.

Upon activating, you need to get the inventory from the interactor (the player, an NPC, blueprint) then call [SetLootSource](../inventory-component/functions.md#set-loot-source) and set the new Loot Source to the blueprints inventory (such as the chest).
