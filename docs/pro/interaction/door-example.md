# Door Example

In this example we are going create a basic door.

Right click in the **Content Drawer** -> **Blueprint Class** and call it:

```
BP_Door
```

Add a static mesh component and add a basic door frame, then another static mesh for the door.

![door-example-blueprint](/img/interaction/door-example-blueprint.webp)

Add a bool variable to determine whether its open or closed. We will call this one:

```
IsClosed
```

Add an event called **OpenDoor** then apply logic to transform the door. In this case, we'll use a simple Timeline to rotate the door to an open position.

You can also create a **CloseDoor** event then apply that to the **ReverseFromEnd** exec pin on the timeline.

When the timeline is finished, reverse the state of the bool using a NOT node.

### Interactable blueprint

Now we can create an interactable. Right click in the **Content Drawer** -> **Blueprint Class** -> **Narrative Interactable** and call it: 

```
Interactable_Door
```

Click **Class Defaults** and enter some detail properties. In this case, we'll set the doors interaction text to **Open**.

Next, override the function `On Interact`. This is where you can tell your interactable what to do when interacted with.

Cast **GetOwner** to the door, then activate either the **OpenDoor** or **ClosedDoor** events depending on the **IsClosed** bool.

Now you can add this component to your door. When you interact with it, the door will open, interacting with again will close it.

:::note

This is a really basic example to demonstrate NarrativeInteraction. It's advised to use interfaces or inheritance based classes to make it much more generic.

## Locked state

On the BP_Door we created above, Add a `Unlocked` property add default it to true.

:::note

If you can't set the default, make sure you compile first. You can only set defaults after you compile.

:::

Now we can override `CanInteract` and get the doors locked state. Create a branch and if It's true, we can simply return true otherwise if its false, we can return the parent can interact function.

## Button Unlock

Create a button blueprint class then add a variable of type **BP_Door** to link to the correct door.

![chaining-interactable-components-variable.webp](/img/interaction/chaining-interactable-components-variable.webp)

Then add a Narrative interactable component and override the event **On Interacted**. 

Get the door and then the doors interactable and set the **unlocked** property to true.

![chaining-interactable-components-on-interacted-event.webp](/img/interaction/chaining-interactable-components-on-interacted-event.webp)

Now when you run up to the door, it will be locked by default.

![chaining-interactable-components-door.webp](/img/interaction/chaining-interactable-components-door.webp)

But when you interact with the button.

![chaining-interactable-components-unlock.webp](/img/interaction/chaining-interactable-components-unlock.webp)

The door will now be unlocked.

![chaining-interactable-components-unlocked.webp](/img/interaction/chaining-interactable-components-unlocked.webp)

:::note

You will notice this time we didn't create an interactable for the button. All interactable functions are exposed for you to use inside an interactable or more specifically on a blueprint.

## Multiplayer

Narrative Interactable is fully replicated right out of the box.

To set up the replication we will use the door example. 

Firstly disconnect the **Closed** set variable and set the **Replication** to be **RepNotify**.

![door-interaction-multiplayer-repnotify.webp](/img/interaction/door-interaction-multiplayer-repnotify.webp)

Override the OnRep_Open function and call your new **OpenDoor** event.

![multiplayer-onrepopen.webp](/img/interaction/multiplayer-onrepopen.webp)

Finally, open the class defaults for the interactable actor and choose Replicates in the details panel.
