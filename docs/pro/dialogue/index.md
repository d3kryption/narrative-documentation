# Dialogue

Dialogue is a feature rich core system that allows you to create complex AAA dialogue with ease.

You can adjust anything from speakers, cameras, text, audio, sequences with a bunch of easy to understand settings.

## Creation

Create a new dialogue by right-clicking in the **Content Drawer** -> **Narrative** -> **Dialogue**.

### Tabs

Here you will see two tabs. The **Dialogue Graph** and the **Event Graph**.

**The Event Graph** is where you can overwrite dialogue functions and add additional code to make your dialogue perform how you want.

**The Dialogue Graph** is how you build up the dialogue with **dialogue nodes**.

### Class Defaults

Click the **Class Defaults** button at the top, and we can now populate the **Dialogues default settings**.

The class defaults give you access to modify how your dialogue will work. It lets you change the speakers in the dialogue, camera settings, character settings and more.

## Copy and pasting

Dialogue can be a time-consuming task to write and often, writers will not use Unreal to write the story and script. Narrative supports a copy-and-paste standard to help create dialogue faster.

You can create Dialogue simply by copying the speaker ID and text in the following format.

```
SpeakerID: Text
```

For example:
```
Reubs: Hey! Welcome to Narrative
Dan: Thanks!
Player: Who is Dan?
Reubs: Everyone knows Dan! You just need to decrypt it...
```

Narrative will take this and automatically create the speakers if they do not exist, create all the nodes and joint them the best it can.

Narrative does not let you import from Excel files, CSVâ€™s or any other media.

:::warning

Copying and pasting dialogue nodes have been disabled until further notice. 

It was causing corruption in assets and until it can be resolved up to the high Narrative standard, it has been removed.

## Player Name

Narrative Pro allows you to set a default name for your player. Simply go to **Edit** -> **Project Settings** -> **Narrative Pro**.

Set the `Default Username` to the name you want for the player.

:::note

If you want to use the default username, leave this blank, and it will load the platform name (steam username, PlayStation PSN) 

You can also override this using the [ChangeName](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/BlueprintAPI/Game/ChangeName?application_version=5.4) node.

## Comments

You can add Unreal's comments around your dialogue to organise them or make them easier to debug at a glance.

Simply highlight your dialogue nodes and hit the **C** key to add the comment.
