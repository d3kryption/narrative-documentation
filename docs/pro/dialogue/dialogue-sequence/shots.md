# Shots

Dialogue shots are a key part of archiving the cinematic look you want for your game. 

Narrative comes packaged with many built-in shots for you to use. 

Narrative's shot system uses Unreal's Cinematics System to give you maximum flexibility when creating the dialogue you want.

## Birds Eye

This shot is used when you want to view two characters from a distance. Imagine a bird flying around looking down.

## Bound Narrative Level Sequence

When you want to use a custom sequence with Narrative controlling its features and replacing NPCs via bound actors.
