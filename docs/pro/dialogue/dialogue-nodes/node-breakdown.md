## Dialogue Line

The dialogue line is the text, audio, camera and settings you want in the specific line that is being played.

These are seperated from the Node as during dialogue, you only need the base settings in order to process the shot making it more lightweight.

## NPC Dialogue Line

The line class is the standard for all dialogue nodes. This class inherits from it and adds extra variables.

NPC's have specific extra fields for added functionality that the player does not need.
