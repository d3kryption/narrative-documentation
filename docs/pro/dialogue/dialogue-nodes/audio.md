# Audio

Each dialogue node contains a **Dialogue Sound** variable that you can attach your sounds to.

## Audio missing error
Narrative will display an icon when a node is missing audio. This is a helpful hint to tell the user when they have missed it.

This can be disabled by going to **Edit** -> **Project Settings** -> **Narrative Dialogues - Editor** and unchecking `Warn Missing Sound Cues`
