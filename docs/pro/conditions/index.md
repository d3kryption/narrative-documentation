# Conditions

Conditions are a powerful tool that allows you to control the flow of dialogue based on any condition you require.

They are small portions of code (mainly generic and reusable, but they can also be specific) that allow you to check a value and have it act as the gate to the next [dialogue node](../dialogue/dialogue-nodes) to enter.

- Should a node only be used if the player has a specific item? Add a condition.
- Do you want to only go down a nodes route if the player has completed a quest? Add a condition.
- Want to only play a node a single time? Add a condition.

Conditions allow you to add multiple conditions to a node. All of these conditions must be met for [Dialogue](../dialogue) to proceed. 

If even one is not met, the node will be rejected for use. If you require "this or that" logic, use two nodes instead.

:::note

Quest conditions currently do not work. You can archive the same result using [branches](../quests/branches.md).

It has been left here since there is a discussion in the community to whether it should be made available or not.

## Using Conditions

To add a condition to a node, simply select the node and in the details screen and add as many conditions to your Conditions list as you require.

## Default Conditions

Narrative comes with a bunch of [default conditions](./default-conditions.md) to help kickstart your game.

## Creating Conditions

It is very common to create your own conditions to implement logic. This could be to interface with other plugins or to do something unique for your game.

Creating Conditions are really easy. Create a new condition by right-clicking in the **Content Drawer** -> **Narrative** -> **Condition**.

Simply override `CheckCondition` and action your request.

:::note

A key thing to remember with Conditions is to always make it return true or false. If you donâ€™t, it can cause issues with Narrative waiting for the condition to finish. 

If you return true, it will allow the node to be used. If you return false, it will look for another node, otherwise end the dialogue.

:::note

You do not need to build a NOT / invert for your condition. Narrative Conditions build this in by default.
