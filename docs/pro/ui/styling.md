# Styling

Narrative UI can easily be styled to change common items across the styling such as fonts and colours.

## Font changing

To change the font for every UI, go into **NarrativePro** -> **NarrativeCommonUI** -> **Style** -> **Master Styles** -> **Text**.

Open **TextStyle_NarrativeMaster**.

## Colors

To change the default system theme color, go to **Edit** -> **Project Settings** -> **Plugins** -> **Narrative Pro**.

Under **User Interface** you can set the UI Primary and Invert color.

At the time of writing, CommonUI does not support the ability to have a single color across all widgets.

For this, you need to populate the styles for each section.

Inside each of the MasterStyle folders, there will be Primary and Invert styles. Paste / set your colors from above into each of these to set the games color.
