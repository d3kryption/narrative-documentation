# Factions

Factions is a feature which allows you to assign NPC's to specific groups with their own behaviors and logic towards other factions.

For example, you could have the high ranking gang of the **Tunnel Snakes** with their legions of members (_three_) and they can be set to aggressive against the Brotherhood.

## Usage

## Game State

The game state controls all alliances between all factions. It allows you to set which factions are friendly, neutral or hostel to one another.
