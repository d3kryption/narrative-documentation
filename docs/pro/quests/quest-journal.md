# Quest Journal

Narrative Pro features a fully functional Quest Journal to allow players to view all details about their quests.

Whether its past or present quests, the player has the option to view all the details and objectives that were failed or completed.

You can even track and untrack quests to hide their state from the world.

The Quest Journal contains a toggle for [Party Quests](../parties/quests.md) too.
