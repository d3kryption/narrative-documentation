# Branches

Narrative's branch system is the decision points for quests.

If you want a linear quest where each objective is the only path you can take, then you will have a simple state / branch quest.

However, many games like to have non-linear quests where the player can pick from different objectives to change the quest.

A great example of linear vs non-linear quests.

## Linear Quest example

A linear quest would be a quest such as **Ryder** from Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.

A quest where you follow a character to a shop. You purchase a new hair cut. You then proceed to purchase food from a shop.  

You then drive home. 

Straight forward, no multiple objectives - great for lore expansion and games that don't need to provide options to the player.

## Non-linear Quest example

A non-linear quest example would be the opening quest from Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.

The quest has different twists and objectives that the player can take.

An example is at some point in the quest, you have to choose which faction you want to go with. The Imperials or the Storm-cloaks.

Taking one of the paths completely changes the rest of that quest.

## Tasks

Tasks are objectives within your quest. Things that the player needs to accomplish in order to complete the current branch.

A branch can contain multiple tasks which all need to be completed before the branch can move to the next state.

You can learn more about [Narrative Tasks](./tasks/index.md) here.
