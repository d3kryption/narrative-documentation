# NPCs

Narrative Pro has a new NPC Subsystem which handles the spawning, creation, finding and all properties for NPCs.

All NPC details are stored as data assets, then spawned and managed by the Subsystem.

## Creating a new NPC

To create a new NPC, Narrative Pro comes packaged with a data asset type called ``.

Open Your **Content Drawer** -> Go to the folder where you want to store **NPC Data Assets** -> Right Click -> **Miscellaneous** -> **Data Asset**

![npc-new-data-asset.webp](/img/pro/npcs/npc-new-data-asset.webp)

Select `NPCDefinition` and name it after your NPC. It will automatically populate some of the information based on the file name.

## Spawning an NPC

Using the NPC Manager you can spawn NPCs by getting the **Narrative NPC Subsystem** -> **Spawn NPC**

Another method of spawning NPC's into the world is to use [Settlements](../settlements)

Main characters, for example, generally only want a max of one spawned at a time, whilst a generic bandit might have as many instances as we want.    |

Since there is only one unique GUID defined here, this will nicely guarantee unique NPCs only ever have 1 save record created per NPC. |
