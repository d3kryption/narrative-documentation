# Installation

To get started, we will be using the Blank C++ template.

:::note

C++ is not required, but it gives you the ability to debug any issues and make tweaks to code if you need to.

## Manual

Set up the project, then download **Narrative Pro** from the Fab Marketplace and you can install it to the engine (default) or move it into your project's Plugins folder (you may have to create this folder).

Make sure to enable **Narrative Pro** by going to edit -> Plugins, and checking the box next to **Narrative Pro**. (you may have to restart Unreal)

We are now ready to configure Narrative Pro.
