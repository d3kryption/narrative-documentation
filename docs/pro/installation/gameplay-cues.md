# Gameplay Cues

One small change we need to make in order for Gameplay Cues to work, is to transfer the **Gameplay Cues** from **NarrativePro** into your project.

Open your **Content Drawer** and navigate to **Plugins** -> **Narrative Pro Content** -> **Abilities**

Click and drag the **Cues** folder into your **Content** folder.

:::note

The reason we need to move the folder, is at the time of creation (2024/08/31), Epic **GameplayAbilitySystem (GAS)** does not allow **GameplayCues** to exist inside the **Plugins** folder.
