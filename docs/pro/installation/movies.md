# Movies

Narrative Pro has some example movies for the ability system. We need to move these into your projects Movies folder.

Open your file explorer (Explorer, Files etc...) and navigate to your project directory.

Go into **Content** and create a folder called:

```ini
Movies
```

:::note

The Capital **M** is required

:::

Now go into **Plugins** -> **NarrativePro** -> **Content** -> **Movies**

![movieslist.webp](/img/pro/Installation/movies/movieslist.webp)

Copy all the **MP4** files:

- `Dialogue.mp4`
- `MeleeAttack.mp4`
- `PistolAttack.mp4`
- `WeaponBash.mp4`

![moviescopy.webp](/img/pro/Installation/movies/moviescopy.webp)

Into your **project** -> **Content** -> **Movies** then paste these files

![moviespasted.webp](/img/pro/Installation/movies/moviespasted.webp)

:::note

You will not see these files inside **Unreal's Content Drawer**. This is normal behavior.

:::

## Restart
You can now restart Unreal with all the changes we have made.
