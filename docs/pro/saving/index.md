# Saving

The saving system built into Narrative Pro features a full save and load system to load any actor you require in the game.

The save system has a function UI to allow you to create, save, load and delete save game files.

## Get the save system

When you are wanting to save or load, you can get the **Narrative Save Subsystem**. This gives you access to all the functions you need to handle saving.

## Save an actor

To save an actor using Narrative Pro is really easy.

There are two interfaces you can use depending on what you want to save.

### Actor interface

If you want to save an actor with specific variables you can use the interface:

```
Narrative Savable Actor
```

Now you can populate a few main functions.

:::note

The save actor interface will automatically save the **actors transform**, so you don't need to.

:::

#### Set Actor GUID

Each savable actor requires a unique ID in order to create this uniqueness. A [GUID](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20080627-00/?p=21823) is a datatype that can give us this randomness.

:::note

You will need to create the variable `SavedGuid`. It can be called anything, but you need to set it from the **Event SetActor GUID**

:::

#### Get Actor GUID

Simply returns the GUID created above. Used to find the correct actor to load details into.

#### Load Single Actor

The **LoadSingleActor** function tells the **Narrative Save Subsystem** to [load](./loading.md) a specific actors' data. Commonly added to EventBeginPlay.

#### Save Single Actor

The **SingleSingleActor** function tells the **Narrative Save Subsystem** to save a specific actors' data. Commonly added to EventEndPlay.

### Component interface

If you are wanting to save a component then you can use the:

```
Narrative Savable Component
```

## Save Game property

Any variable that you want to save you must mark it as **SaveGame** in the advanced menu.
