# Navigator Component

 The Navigation component is the core component to allow the player to use the Navigation aids and provides access to other Narrative Navigator functions.

## Saving & Loading

Navigator automatically comes with a save and load feature to allow you to save custom markers and unlocked POI’s.

To start saving & loading, you can call the Save or Load functions from the **Navigation** component.

In this example, we save and load when we press the 1 and 2 keys.
