# Navigator

Navigator is a full map system that allows you to create world maps, minimaps, compasses and on screen markers with ease.

You can adjust everything from the colours, icons, positioning to make it exactly how you require.

It contains built in optimisations to make any size map work efficiently without being a huge memory hog.
