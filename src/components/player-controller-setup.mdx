Before we can move on, we need to create a custom PlayerController.

:::note

If you already have a custom PlayerController, you can skip this page.

Simply right-click in your Content Drawer, select Blueprint Class and choose **Player Controller**. We will name this **BP_PlayerController**.

Now open the **BP_ThirdPersonGameMode** and set the Player Controller class to your newly created **BP_PlayerController**.
